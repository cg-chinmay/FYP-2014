The top module is basically an empty block which contains all processor modules.
This empty block is designed to act as a container for all the modules.
A set of local signals are defined inside this top module.
These local signals act as a Link to connect  two ports of sub modules.
The top module also has its own ports defined which gets displayed in final test bench,
Now inorder to view submodule ports in final test bench a connection must be established between submodule port and top module port.
This connection is established by the local signals that act as link.
The local signals apart from connecting two sub module ports also drive the top module ports.
So with this design logic value of any submodule port can be viewed in final test bench.
