The Data memory consists of 256 memory locations which are shared between Stack and RAM.
0 -127 are for stack
128-255 are for RAM.
It has to perform 3 functions:Identify whether the input instruction needs stack e.g in PUSH/PULL or 
RAM e.g Load/STORE and 3rd which is just bypass the data memory and pass the input for write back stage.
Following steps are executed
1.On rising edge of clock check the status of Ram_Stack signal.
-If it is 1 it is stack operation
--If it is a stack operation then next step is to check whether it is Push or Pop.
---For Push check whether the stack is not full,if not full then push the value and decrement stack pointer.
---Similarly for Pop check whether stack is not empty,if not empty then pop out the value and increment stack pointer.

--If Ram_Stack is 0 then it is RAM operation.
---In this case take the input which is the address of memory location and add 128 to it so that the value gets 
stored in RAM section and not stack.

--If Ram_STACK is 'Z' then it is neither Stack nor RAM operation.
---In this case the input value is just forwarded for write back cycle.

Repeat the above steps for every rising edge of the clock.
