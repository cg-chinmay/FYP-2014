Instruction queue is used to store set of instructions fetched from RAM.
Once the queue is filled up, decoder starts fetching instruction from this queue one by one.
Signals used are :
inst_wr : signifies whether instruction should be written inside queue.
Inst_In:16 bit bus which takes in Instructions from RAM.
Inst_Out:16 bit bus which reads out instruction to the decoder.
Inst_ptr:16 bit pointer used while reading instructions,it gets its value from program counter.
wr_inst_ptr:4 bit pointer used for writing instructions into queue from RAM. 4 bit pointer is sufficient to traverse 16 locations of the queue.
 
The algorithm for working of queue is as follows:
1.Check whether clock has toggled its valu from 0 to 1.
2.If true check whether instr_wr signal is enabled.
3.If true calculate index value from wr_inst_ptr.
4.Store the actual instruction received on port inst_in into inst_cache at location pointed by index.
5.Recalculate index from inst_ptr which is an input port (it gets its value from program counter).
6.Read instruction from inst_cache at location index into Inst_Out port which is connected to decoder.
7.Repeat above steps for every rising edge of clock.
