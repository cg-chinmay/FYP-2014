The sign extension block is used to extend a 3 bit ,5 bit, 8 bit, 11 bit immediate value into a 16 bit value.
Three signals are used :
datain:16 bit input signal
imm:2 bit signal to determine whether 3,5,8,11 bit value is to be used as input.
dataout:16 bit output signal

The algorithm is as follows.
1.Check status of imm signal
2.Depending on 3,5,8,11 bit input immediate value take the MSB of input and store it in temp variable.
3.Check whether temp is '1' or '0'.
4.If 1 then append '1' to the input immediate value to make it 16 bit signal
5.If 0 then append all 0's to the input immediate value.
