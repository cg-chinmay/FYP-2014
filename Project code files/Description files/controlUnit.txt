The number of inputs for control unit are equal to the number of outputs of decoder.
The Control unit just passes the recieved signals to other units at correct time or at correct stage of 
the pipeline.
The control Unit is divided into 3 processes:
A.Decode
1.On rising edge buffer the input signals into temporary signals to produce necessary delay.

B.Execute
1.Assign ALU select lines,barrel shifter,register read address ,proper signals from buffered signals in previous step,rest of the signals are again buffered to 
create one more cycle delay.

C.memory
1.Assign the remaining units such data memory actual signals,also assign the register write address.

The above 3 processes are repeated for every rising edge of clock so that they run concurrently.
