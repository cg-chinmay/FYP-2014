The external RAM on Nexys2 Spartan-3E FPGA is 16Mbyte cellular RAM.It is also BIG ENDIAN.
So when instructions are fetched from RAM first higher byte is recieved followed by lower byte.
The signals for RAM controller can be found in the documentation given on xilinx website specific for FPGA board version.
The operating frequency for the RAM has to be less than or eual to 6.25 MHz for proper fetching operation.
For the RAM which we used the operating frequency was set to 6.25 MHz.
It consists of an initial setup procedure which enables the RAM for read operation.
A 23 bit address bus is used to access RAM location.
The addres bus is connected to External RAM address port.
When address bus value changes, the RAM sends out instruction stored at that memory location.
Care must be taken that address port does not change faster than 6.25 Mhz ,which means that the operating frequency for RAM is 6.25 MHz.
The value read from RAM is on a 16 bit bus connected to the Instruction queue input.
