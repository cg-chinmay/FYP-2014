Barrel shifter provides the operand 2 to the ALU.
The operand 2 can be an immediate data or from register bank.
It performs the rotation operation on input data.
It makes use of two functions which are SHR and SHL which are shift right and shift left.
These functions are provided by the vhdl IEEE package.
The 2 signals - direction and rotation are used to determine the direction of shift and amount of bits by which the data 
should be shifted,
The direction and rotation values are set by the decoder.For data forwarding there are 4 signals which are 
data_writeback_cycle:It takes data from write back cycle
data_memory_cycle:It takes data from memory acess cycle
address_writeback: It is the address of write back register
address_memaccess:It is the address during memory access cycle.
The addresses are compared with the input address and if there is a match then the data from appropriate stage is forwarded
to barrel shifter.
