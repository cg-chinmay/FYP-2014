Alu is a combinational design.Depending on the alu select lines the operations are performed
Signals used:
Rn:Operand 2
rd:result
psr:4 bit flag register (NZCV) connected to cpsr
alu_sel:Alu select lines
alu_cy:carry flag status given by decoder 

data forwarding signals:
Rm_reg: operand from register
Rm_mem: operand from data memory (memory access cycle)
Rm_wb:operand taken from write back cycle
input1:Operand 1 address

Algorithm:
Data forwarding
1.Check whether input1 is equal to write_address.If true operand1(Rm) = Rm_wb
2.Check whether input1 is equal to mem_address,if true Rm=Rm_mem
3.Else Rm =Rm_reg that is operand 1 from register bank

For ALU operation
Keep checking status of ALU select lines
Depending on ALU select lines perform corresponding operation such as add,sub and store the result in rd.
The psr flag bits are changed depending on the operation performed.
